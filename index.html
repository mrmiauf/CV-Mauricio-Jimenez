                    <h1>Mauricio <em>Jiménez Agüero</em></h1>
                    <h2>Senior Software Quality Assurance Engineer</h2>
                    <h2><a href="mailto:maupzx@gmail.com">maupzx@gmail.com</a></h2> 
                    <p>As a QA Engineer I have knowledge of methodologies for software analysis and testing strategies, including the accumulated experience working in manual and automated testing for web services and desktop applications during the last years.
                    </p>    
                    <p class="mobile-collapsible">
                    The most recent projects required the design and implementation of automated platforms for API Testing, integrating tools like Postman, Cypress, JMeter, Git and Jenkins for scalability and easier executions in multiple environments.
                    Part of the skills that are put in practice every day are the ability to work effectively in collaborative and remote environments. Also, excellent analytical skills for decision making and detection of unexpected or unwanted behaviors in the product, with tools for manual and automated executions of different types, e.g. exploratory, feature, regression testing, bug reporting, report creation.
                    In this role I must be very communicative and self-driven in daily tasks to correctly manage a prioritized workload to maintain the team aware of the current tasks, milestones, and timelines.
                    With the acquired knowledge of the software development cycle and customer service experience, I can focus on the product from the user perspective to meet and exceed their expectations in a quality product.
